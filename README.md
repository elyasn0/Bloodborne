Bloodborne is probably one of my favorite games. When I replayed the game again, I wanted to explore Central Yharnam's level design in more detail. I started to decompose the location and then decided to make it in Unity. It's not an identical copy and some things in it are unfinished. Despite that I like it.

    Many temporary models such as coffins, fences, buildings, carriages and lampposts I made in Blender
